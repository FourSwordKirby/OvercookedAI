Make sure to select the correct version for your machine

In case there are issues with version differences, the version of Unity we used is:

2017.2.0f3



Once you have Unity installed, open the scene MultiRecipe located inside the Assets/Scenes directory

From there press the play button at the top of the Unity Editor to start the scene. 

Make sure that the Maximize on Play option is not toggled


The buttons on the right side are used to interact with the game environment. They work as follows

ResetWorld: Resets the game world to the initial state

StartSearch: Has the AI generate a plan to complete the recipes that are listed at the top of the screen

Add Onion Soup: Adds a recipe that requires 3 onions to be cooked to complete
Add Mushroom Soup: Adds a recipe that requires 3 mushrooms to be cooked to complete

Autoplay: The game automatically executes the plan that was generated by the StartSearch Button.
    Once Autoplay starts, it cannot be stopped    

Keyboard Controls:
    Up/Down Arrows: Used to manually step through the plan once generated
    Left/Right Arrows: Used to determine which object you are interacting with
    Z: Used to pick up and place objects
    X: Used to prepare ingredients/submit orders

    Space bar: Performs the full search
    B: Initializes the planner for the current state
    N: Runs the search for 10k expansions
    M: Finishes a partially completed search to completion

See the writeup for a full description of the game and additional details


In case of errors, simply restart the scene by clicking the play button again. 

The program should find solutions for a single onion soup order fairly quickly.
A solution that looks for a single onion soup and a single mushroom soup should also be found in under 15 seconds
Dynamically looking for a new solution after completing a plan partway sometimes completes quickly, but sometimes 
takes more time than we allotted. In addition, because there are only 2 available plates, the environment is not
able to allow for the submission of 3 orders, so any planning tha requires 3 orders will time out.
